<Bold>Mexican Government Acquisitions 2018</Bold>

<Bold>Web Application functionality</Bold>

The application shows the acquisitions performed by the Mexican goverment during 2018 through the procurement platform known as Compranet (https://compranet.funcionpublica.gob.mx/web/login.html). 

The source of the data has been obtained from https://datos.gob.mx/, the open data site of the Mexican Goverment.  

The application allows to select the amount range of the contracts awarded during 2018 though slides controls. Once selected the cost range, the data frame is filtered and a plot is updated dynamically, showing a chart with the different sort of contracts awarded through the Compranet acquisitions platform.  The size of the point corresponds to the amount of the contract awarded.

The application gives an overview of where audits could be potentially focused depending on the amounts and type of acquisition procedure applied. 

Data labels and categories have been translated to English for better understanding.
